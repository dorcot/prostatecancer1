        <h2>What is Prostate Cancer?</h2>
        <p>Prostate cancer is a type of cancer that develops in the prostate, a small gland in the male reproductive system. It usually grows slowly and initially remains confined to the prostate gland, where it may not cause serious harm. However, some types of prostate cancer can be aggressive and spread quickly.</p>
